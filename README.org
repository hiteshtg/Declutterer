* 📂 Declutterer - File Organizer Tool

Declutterer is a simple yet effective Python-based file organizer. It helps you clean up a given directory by moving files into categorized subfolders based on file extensions.

This is ideal for cleaning up cluttered directories like `~/Downloads`, `~/.config`, or any directory with mixed file types.

* ✅ Features

- Recursively organize files in a directory and its subdirectories
- Automatically categorizes files by extension (customizable)
- Simple command-line script
- Prevents creating duplicate folders if they already exist

* 🚀 Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository**
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/hiteshtg/Declutterer.git
cd Declutterer
#+end_src

**2. Make sure you have Python installed**
Test with:
#+begin_src sh
python3 --version
#+end_src

**3. Create or edit your extension mapping**
The file categorization is based on =helper.py=, which contains an extension dictionary like:

#+begin_src python
ext_dict = {
    "Documents": [".pdf", ".docx", ".txt"],
    "Images": [".jpg", ".png", ".gif"],
    "Videos": [".mp4", ".mkv"],
    "Archives": [".zip", ".tar.gz", ".rar"],
    ;; Add more categories and extensions as needed
}
#+end_src

**4. Run the script**
Edit the =path= variable in =main.py= with the target directory and then run:
#+begin_src sh
python3 main.py
#+end_src

* 🔧 Planned Features

- [ ] Add support for ~--dry-run~ to preview actions without making changes
- [ ] Add ~--verbose~ mode to print details of each move
- [ ] Add command-line arguments to dynamically set the path

* 💡 Example

If you set =path="/home/hitesh/.config/"= and run the script, files will be organized into folders like:

#+begin_example
/home/hitesh/.config/
├── Documents/
│   └── notes.txt
├── Images/
│   └── wallpaper.png
└── ...
#+end_example
